# Overview
The Playing Cards dataset is a collection of synthetically generated cards blended into various types of backgrounds. You will be able to perform object detection to detect both number and suit of the cards.

# Training and Deployment

The playing cards model has been trained in Roboflow, available for inference on the Dataset tab.

One could also build a Card Counting model for either Black Jack or Poker using YOLOR. This is achieved using the Roboflow Platform which you can deploy the model for robust and real-time detections. You can learn more here:  https://augmentedstartups.info/YOLOR-Get-Started

Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 24240 images.
Cards are annotated in COCO format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 15 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -10 and +10 degrees
* Random shear of between -2째 to +2째 horizontally and -2째 to +2째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.75 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 2 percent of pixels
